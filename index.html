       Hello as you can see from my heading my name is Racheal Spears
      <br> I was born in Kansas City on April 17 in the year 1990.
      <br> I'm a fun loving free spirited person
       who loves a challenge.<br> I played Saxaphone from the 7th grade all through highschool
       I still like to play at home even though I wish i had more time to play.<br>
       Music is life to me so my hobbies are going to concerts and I am an avide Kansas City 
       Sports fan so I love going to see the Chiefs play at Arrowhead Stadium
       or going to see the Royals swing away at Kauffman. And every once in awhile i'll go watch a Kansas City Mavericks hockey game.
